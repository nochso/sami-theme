# nochso/sami-theme Theme for the Sami API doc generator

[![Latest Stable Version](https://poser.pugx.org/nochso/sami-theme/v/stable)](https://packagist.org/packages/nochso/sami-theme)
[![License](https://poser.pugx.org/nochso/sami-theme/license)](LICENSE)

This is a theme for the [Sami] API documentation generator with some added features:

- The complete file source is included at the end.
- Source code highlighting with [prismjs](http://prismjs.com/).
- Show the value / assignment of class constants.
- HTML is minified using [wyrihaximus/html-compress][html-compress].

An an example take a look at the [API docs](http://nochso.github.io/Benchmark/docs/) for the [nochso/Benchmark](https://github.com/nochso/Benchmark/) library.

## Installation

If you haven't used [Sami] before, please read up on its installation and basic usage first.

When you're ready, require the theme in your project:

```sh
$ composer require nochso/sami-theme
```

## Usage

In your [Sami configuration file](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/Sami#configuration) simply call `Theme::prepare` to
inject the theme into your Sami instance right before returning it:

```php
return \nochso\SamiTheme\Theme::prepare($sami);
```

e.g.
```php
<?php

use Sami\Sami;
use Symfony\Component\Finder\Finder;

$finder = Finder::create()
    ->files()
    ->name('*.php')
    ->in(__DIR__.'/src');

$config = array(
    'title' => 'Project documentation title',
    'build_dir' => __DIR__.'/build',
    'cache_dir' => __DIR__.'/cache',
);

$sami = new Sami($finder, $config);
$sami = \nochso\SamiTheme\Theme::prepare($sami);
return $sami;
```

This looks for PHP files in `src/` and saves the resulting documentation in `build/`.

These results are now ready for you to upload and share!
